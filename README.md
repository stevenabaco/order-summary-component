## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Doing this project I strengthened my HTML and CSS skills to build a component using the Figma designs provided. It took some time to code all the media breakpoints but in the end turned out well and it was a good excersise. I now have a component I could use in future projects.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue fine tuning my CSS skills to enhace the UI experience. I also need to work on improving my use of semantic HTML to help readers understand the page.

### Useful resources

- [stackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/13629204/steven-abaco) - The stackOverlow website helped me with solving some of the CSS issues I had with linking the images to be properly renedered when using the background image for a div, instead of loading a seperate image. I highly recommend developers use this resource.
